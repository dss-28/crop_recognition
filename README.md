Got it 🚀
Here’s your **same README** but made **more attractive** with emojis, badges, visuals, and structure polish.

![Accuracy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Accuracy-98%25-brightgreen.svg)
![Speedup](https://img.shields.io/badge/Training-70x%20Faster-orange.svg)

Identify crops from **RGB images** using **classical machine learning**, engineered features, and **ensemble modeling**.
Achieved **98% validation accuracy** with a **70× training speedup** over CNNs — while staying **interpretable and efficient**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project classifies **five crop types** — **Wheat, Rice, Maize, Sugarcane, and Jowar** — using **traditional ML approaches** instead of CNNs.

### 🧠 Why?

Deep CNNs are powerful but:

* ❌ Require huge datasets
* ❌ Expensive to train
* ❌ Less interpretable

We built a **faster, interpretable solution** that works well **even with limited data**.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

* 🎨 **5 handcrafted image features**: Color Histogram, Haralick, LBP, HOG, Fourier
* 📉 **PCA-based fusion** (150,000 → 512 dimensions)
* 🔧 **6+ ML models** with hyperparameter tuning
* 🧩 **Two ensemble layers** for final classification
* 📈 **98% validation accuracy**
* ⚡ **70× faster** training than CNNs

---

## 📂 Dataset

* 📸 **1000 RGB crop images**
* 🌱 **5 classes**: Wheat, Rice, Maize, Sugarcane, Jowar
* 📐 Preprocessed: resized to **224×224**
* 📁 Source: Public dataset from **Kaggle**

## 🔬 Feature Extraction

| Feature Type       | Description                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 🎨 Color Histogram | Dominant RGB color distributions        |
| 🧵 Haralick        | Texture info from co-occurrence matrix  |
| 🔳 LBP             | Local grayscale structure (patterns)    |
| ➖ HOG              | Edges + shape representation            |
| 📊 Fourier         | Frequency domain texture representation |

➡️ Final **512-D vector** after PCA

## 🖼️ Pipeline (Conceptual Flow)

```
Image → Feature Extraction (Color, HOG, LBP, Haralick, Fourier) 
      → PCA (150k → 512) 
      → ML Models (SVM, DT, KNN, etc.) 
      → Ensemble Classifier 
      → 🌾 Crop Prediction
```

## 🤖 Models Used

### 🔹 Base Models

* SVM
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Naïve Bayes
* KNN

### 🔹 Ensembles

* **Voting Classifier 1** → Base models combined
* **Voting Classifier 2** →

  * Bagging (Tree, SVM, RF)
  * Boosting (AdaBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boost)

🏆 **Best Model:** *Voting Classifier 2*

* 📈 Accuracy: **98%** (val/test)
* ⚡ Training Time: **70× faster** than CNN baselines

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* ✅ Accuracy: **98%**
* ✅ F1-score: **0.98**
* ✅ Confusion Matrix → in `results/`

*(You can embed the plot here: `assets/confusion_matrix.png`)*

✨ *This project proves that with clever feature engineering and ensembles, traditional ML can rival CNNs in accuracy — while being much faster and more interpretable.*

Would you like me to actually **design a pipeline diagram + confusion matrix sample plot** for you (so you can directly upload images to `assets/` and reference in the README)?
